# Appetiser App Exam
This is the coding challenge exam from appetiser.
### Technology Stack

* Android Studio 3.4.1
* Android SDK 28
* Supported OS: Mashmallow up to latest
* Gradle 5.1.1
* Model-View-Presenter (MVP) Pattern Architechture - an application can be more maintainable and it makes views independent from our data source. We divide the application into at least three different layers, which lets us test them independently and we take most of the logic out from the activities. Maintains code simplicity and reusability which in turn promotes higher testability.

### Dependencies

It uses number of open source libraries:

* [Realm] - One of the best alternative to SQLite and Core Data, and much faster than an ORM, and often faster than raw SQLite.
* [Retrofit 2.0] - An open source library which simplifies HTTP communication by turning remote APIs into declarative, type-safe interfaces. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice. It automatically serializes the JSON response using a POJO which must be defined in advanced for the JSON Structure.
* [Dagger 2.0] - Dependecy injection framework, provides a simple way to obtain references to shared instances.
* [RxJava 2.0] - Reactive programming provides a clean, efficient way of processing and reacting to streams of real-time data, including data with dynamic values.
* [Butter Knife] - Field and method binding for Android views. It makes your code less and more clear. It is time saving to write repetitive lines of code. Also to avoid writing repetitive code just like `findViewById(R.id.yourview)`.
* [Picasso] - An image loading/processing library developed and maintained by Square Inc. Itâ€™s immensely popular since it often requires just one line of code.
